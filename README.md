# DataStructure_And_Algorithms

A dedicated repository for my learning and problem-solving journey in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. This repo includes curated solutions from **LeetCode**, **HackerRank**, and **GeeksforGeeks (GFG)**, organized by platform and problem type.

---

## 📌 Platforms Covered

- **LeetCode** – Interview-level DSA questions across topics
- **HackerRank** – Logic-based and language-specific practice
- **GFG** – Conceptual problems and theory-based practice
