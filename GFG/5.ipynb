    "You are given an array arr[] containing positive integers. The elements in the array arr[] range from 1 to n (where n is the size of the array), and some numbers may be repeated or absent. Your task is to count the frequency of all numbers in the range 1 to n and return an array of size n such that result[i] represents the frequency of the number i (1-based indexing).\n",
